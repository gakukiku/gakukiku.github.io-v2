            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio has been a transformative journey that showed my growth from a beginner programmer to a well-rounded software developer. When I first created a simple restaurant app in CS 360 with hardcoded data and basic features, I never imagined it would evolve into a comprehensive database-driven system with nine connected tables, secure authentication, and optimized performance. This ePortfolio represents not just my technical achievements, but my evolution as a problem-solver, collaborator, and security-minded developer ready to enter the computer science field.</p>

            <p>My journey was significantly influenced by real-world industry exposure, including a job interview with a Japanese cybersecurity company that sparked my deep interest in security technologies. This experience opened my eyes to the critical importance of cybersecurity and helped shape my career goals. As I begin my professional journey with Kyndryl Japan as an IT infrastructure consultant, I can apply the skills demonstrated in this ePortfolio while continuing to explore and develop my career path.</p>

            <p>Working in IT infrastructure consulting will provide invaluable hands-on experience with enterprise technology solutions. I plan to use this opportunity to explore various career paths within the field. While my immediate focus is infrastructure consulting, I am actively pursuing specialization in cloud architecture and cybersecurity. My long-term vision is to develop expertise as a cloud and security specialist, potentially evolving into architecture roles where I can design comprehensive technology solutions. The skills I developed through enhancing my artifacts—from mobile development and database design to security implementation—provide a strong foundation for this career evolution.</p>

            <h3>Core Computer Science Skills</h3>
            
            <h4>Working in Team Environments</h4>
            <p>Throughout my computer science program, I developed essential teamwork skills through various team-based projects and iterative development processes. During CS 499, I experienced meaningful collaboration through the milestone feedback system, where I incorporated instructor guidance to improve my database enhancement from a basic SQLite implementation to a sophisticated system with proper organization and security features. This iterative process taught me the value of receiving constructive criticism and adapting my approach based on expert feedback.</p>

            <h4>Communicating with Stakeholders</h4>
            <p>My ability to communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences was significantly strengthened through writing comprehensive reports for each artifact enhancement. When documenting my database migration from Firebase to SQLite, I learned to explain technical decisions in terms of business value—describing not just what I implemented, but why these changes matter for performance, security, and maintainability. This skill of translating technical complexity into clear business benefits will be crucial in my future role as an IT infrastructure consultant.</p>

            <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
            <p>My enhancement of a Binary Search Tree program into an AVL Tree implementation demonstrated my deep understanding of algorithmic efficiency and performance optimization. This project required me to analyze the limitations of basic BST operations and implement rotation algorithms to maintain O(log n) performance guarantees. Through this work, I gained practical experience with complex recursive algorithms and learned to measure and validate performance improvements through systematic testing.</p>

            <h4>Software Engineering and Database</h4>
            <p>My most comprehensive demonstration of software engineering expertise came through completely redesigning my restaurant app's data architecture. I transformed a simple Firebase-connected application into a sophisticated SQLite-based system featuring nine interconnected tables: Users, Restaurants, Menu_Items, Orders, Cart, Favorites, Categories, Order_Items, and Reviews. This enhancement required applying database normalization principles to eliminate data redundancy while maintaining data integrity through carefully designed relationships.</p>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>Developing a security mindset has become integral to my approach to software development, particularly evident in my database enhancement project where I implemented comprehensive security measures. I replaced simple text-based authentication with a robust system featuring password hashing and salt generation, ensuring that user credentials are protected even if the database is compromised. Additionally, I implemented parameterized queries throughout the application to prevent SQL injection attacks, demonstrating my understanding that security must be built into the foundation of any data-driven application.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Integration and Technical Artifacts</h3>
            <p>The three artifacts in my ePortfolio work together to demonstrate the full spectrum of modern software development capabilities required in today's technology landscape. My restaurant mobile app serves as the foundation, showcasing user interface design, mobile development expertise, and full-stack integration skills. The BST to AVL Tree enhancement demonstrates my algorithmic thinking and performance optimization capabilities. Finally, the database enhancement project brings together all these skills in a comprehensive system that addresses real-world data management challenges.</p>

            <p>I selected these artifacts because they represent a logical progression from theoretical computer science concepts to practical, industry-applicable solutions. The Binary Search Tree work provided the algorithmic foundation that I applied throughout the application development process. The mobile development skills from CS 360 evolved into the comprehensive React Native application with sophisticated state management and database integration. This progression demonstrates not just technical growth, but the ability to integrate knowledge across different areas of computer science.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This ePortfolio represents my transformation from a student learning isolated concepts to a developer capable of delivering integrated, professional-quality solutions. The skills I demonstrated—from database design and algorithm optimization to security implementation and user interface development—directly prepare me for my upcoming role with Kyndryl Japan in IT infrastructure consulting.</p>

            <p>My technical expertise, demonstrated through comprehensive database design, algorithm optimization, and security implementation, directly prepares me for my upcoming role with Kyndryl Japan in IT infrastructure consulting. As I begin this professional journey, I am excited to apply these skills in real enterprise environments while continuing to develop my specialization in cloud architecture and cybersecurity. As I enter the professional computer science field, I carry with me not just technical skills, but a proven ability to learn, adapt, and deliver results. This ePortfolio stands as evidence of my readiness to tackle the complex challenges that define modern software development and infrastructure management.</p>
